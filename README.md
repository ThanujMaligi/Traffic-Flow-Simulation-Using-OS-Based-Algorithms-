# Traffic Flow Simulation Using OS-Based Algorithms

## Overview
This project simulates traffic flow at a four-way intersection, comparing system performance before and after implementing Operating System (OS) algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and priority scheduling. It prioritizes emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances) to reduce delays, using Python and Pygame for visualization. The simulation models traffic lanes as CPU units, applying concepts like multithreading and dynamic resource allocation.
